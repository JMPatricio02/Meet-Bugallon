	<P>Father Antonio Perez founded the Salasa Parish in 1714 and built a church from 1720 up to 1733. With his efforts, the church was accepted as a Dominican Order vicariate. Father Francisco Barroso began the construction of the church in 1747 and finished the work in 1748. Fr. Juan Terres made repairs and renovations on the church from 1874 to 1885. In 1937, the church was opened under the Capuchin monks with Our Lady of Lourdes as their Patron. However, due to the Great Flood of 1953 caused by the overflowing of Agno River, the church suffered massive damages. Its roof, images, benches, liturgical objects were transferred to its present site in the barangay of Salasa except the two side altars and the Saint Andrew the Apostle statue at the fa√ßade, which remained at its location in the poblacion.</P>
